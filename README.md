- Sequential-modular simulation
- Dynamic simulation
- Introduction to UniSim - Process industry applications

## b) Modelling and Simulation of Discrete Event Systems
- Specifications of discrete event systems
- Compositional modelling of discrete event systems
- Object-oriented simulation of discrete event systems
- Introduction to Arena and Plant Simulation (formerly Simple ++, eM Plant)
